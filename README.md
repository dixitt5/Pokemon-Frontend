## Build Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ if you don't have it already.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project. This is usually where you'll find the package.json file.

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server:

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically on port 3000.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.

Now you're ready to start developing!
